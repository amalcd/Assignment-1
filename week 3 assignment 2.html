                </h3>
                <p>[Spoken Intro]<br><br>And disciplinary remains mercifully<br>Yes and um, I'm with you Derek, this star nonsense<br>Yes, yes, now which is it?<br>I am sure of it<br><br>[Intro]<br><br>[Verse]<br>So, so you think you can tell<br>Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?<br> you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?<br>A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?<br>Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?<br>Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?<br>Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange<br>A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?<br><br>[Acoustic Guitar Solo]<br><br>[Chorus]<br>How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year<br>Running over the same old ground, what have we found?<br>The same old fears, wish you were here<br><br>[Outro]<br>
